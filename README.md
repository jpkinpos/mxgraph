mxgraph
=======

mxGraph is a fully client side JavaScript diagramming library. It is the underlying technology that powers the drawing functionality that you see in https://www.draw.io.

We started developing mxGraph in 2005 when Internet Explorer 6 and Firefox 1.5 were the latest browsers, thus we still support all browsers back this far for IE and FF, as well as most Opera, Chrome and Safari versions. mxGraph supports iOS and Android touch events.

mxGraph uses the vector drawing language native to the browser being used, VML for IE 8- and SVG for more modern browsers.

mxGraph uses no third-party software, it requires no plugins and can be integrated in virtually any framework. Also provided is server-side functionality in Java and .NET for persistence (open and save) functionality, as well as server-side image generation.

mxGraph is dual licensed. It is licensed under the non-commercial CC, http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/, and the mxGraph license, http://www.jgraph.com/mxlicense.html. The mxGraph license is for commercial use, you can find the pricing at http://www.jgraph.com/purchase.html.
